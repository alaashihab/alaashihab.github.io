        <h2> About Yuna</h2>
            <p>
            Yuna is a one-year-old Siberian cat with a heart as soft as her fur. 
            Born with a curious mind and an endless sense of adventure, she spends her days 
            exploring every corner of her home, whether it’s climbing onto the windowsill, 
            chasing the shadow of a passing bird, or curling up in the warmest patch of sunlight she can find. 
            Siberians are known for their intelligence and hypoallergenic coats, but Yuna stands out for her
            expressive eyes and her gentle yet dramatic personality. She loves being around her humans, 
            often meowing as if she’s part of the conversation. Between naps, purrs, and playtime, Yuna 
            brings a touch of joy and serenity to the everyday, a perfect reminder that curiosity and comfort
            can coexist beautifully.
